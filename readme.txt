Description: 

A hash map is initially used with a hash function to generate values for each word. Each alphabet is encoded with powers of 5 and 7( sum of powers of prime
numbers) in order to make sure that unique hash values are generated for each word except the words with exactly same characters but with different order.
This hash map is used to calculate the children by adding or subtracting the encoded values of each alphabet and checking against the hash table thus enabing
a faster computation. And finally a breadth first search algorithm is used to traverse through the hashed nodes to find out the shortest path.
